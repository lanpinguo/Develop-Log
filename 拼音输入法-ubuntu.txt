My system had a similar problem: I was able to choose "Chinese", but it didn't really input any Chinese. The key step missing was to install a specific Chinese input method/package. E.g.:

sudo apt-get install ibus-pinyin 
After installing Pinyin in this example, go to System Settings 鈫?Language Support 鈫?Chinese (Pinyin).

Now it works as expected.

This thread helped me to figure out this solution. It also suggests another input method:

sudo apt-get install ibus-sunpinyin
