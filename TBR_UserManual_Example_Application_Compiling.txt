There are example applications in [wiki:Developer/Git RTEMS GIT Repository].

= Compile the Examples =


Assume you complete the steps in [wiki:TBR/UserManual/Quick_Start Quick Start] which take SPARC as example, here are example steps for i386 and rtems-4.11.

{{{
cd rtems
export PATH=/opt/rtems-4.11/bin:$PATH
./bootstrap
cd ..
mkdir pc386
cd pc386
../rtems/configure --target=i386-rtems4.11 --enable-rtemsbsp=pc386 \
  --enable-tests=samples --disable-posix \
  --prefix=INSTALL_POINT
make
}}}

After the steps above, RTEMS code including sample applications in test suites are compiled, the sample applications are ready to run in directory such as:
${HOME}/WHERE_AM_I_BUILDING/pc386/i386-rtems4.11/c/pc386/testsuites/samples

However, how to compile your own application? Here are the steps to compile examples in [wiki:Developer/Git RTEMS GIT Repository]. 

First, install RTEMS files into the ''INSTALL_POINT'' specified to the ''--prefix'' option above. 

{{{
# If the INSTALL_POINT requires root access, you will have to perform this step.
# NOTE: If the install as root fails due to not having RTEMS tools in your PATH,
#       you will have to "export PATH=/opt/rtems-4.11/bin:$PATH" as well.
su -

cd rtems/../pc386/
make install

# If the INSTALL_POINT requires root access, you will have to perform this step.
exit
}}}

Second, compile the examples.

{{{
cd examples-v2
export RTEMS_MAKEFILE_PATH=INSTALL_POINT/i386-rtems4.11/pc386
make
}}}

You complete it, the example applications are ready to run in directories, such as ${HOME}/WHERE_AM_I_BUILDING/examples/hello_world_c/o-optimize. You can use [https://devel.rtems.org/wiki/Developer/Simulators/QEMU QEMU] to run those example applications.
