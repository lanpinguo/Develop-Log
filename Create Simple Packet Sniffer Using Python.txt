Introduction

In today's life networks is playing a very important role in telecommunication. without the network, almost all types of communication and service are useless. hence, this makes network concept more important for all programmers and network administrators.

To maintain and manage the security of network communication, many times network administrators Or network maintainers need to find and control the traffic flowing into the network wire and also find exactly what and which types of data packets are actually flowing into the networks.
For this situation, there are many types of Network analyzing tools are available On the internet.  basically, these types of tool come on the ground to help network administrator like Wireshark and other. These tools are fast, easy and reliable to handle many types of network problems but as we know, networking concept is not that easy. so, many time these types of tools do not support our exact situation requirement and we have to find any other solution for our problem and at that time python and its socket module comes on the ground like a big boy to help network administrators.

Well, as we know python is really the very awesome language and also very powerful language. With Python, a programmer can do almost any types of programming in fastest and easiest way. hence, with python and socket module, our today project is very easy to codes if compared to other programming languages. But as usual, Networking is always very harder for mostly all programmers Because networking concept is very big and complex to understand.
That's why Friends, Today's topic can be hard to understand for beginners. why hard? well because for this topic, you need basic knowledge of networking, sockets, packets and the data formats types. But don't worry, I will try my best to explain today's topic in the simplest way.

So, Let's Start Our Topic Step By Step
Some Basic Queries To Under Stand Networking
Q 1. What is Packet Sniffer?

Ans. Friends, As I already told you, Sniffers are the special programs and tools that can capture network traffic packets from the network and then parse/ analyze them for various purposes. actually, sniffing tools have the ability to capture flowing data packets from networks. Data packets like TCP, UDP, ICMP etc. and after capturing these packets, sniffer also provides the facilities to extract these data packets and represent these packets in easy to understand interface. Well, There are many types of sniffers are available but my favorite one is Wireshark. still not Understand? hmm, In Simple Words, Every Client Use Various Types Of Data Packets Like TCP, UDP etc To Interact With Server. These data packets always travel from any network source. and what we are going to do? is Just capture those traveling packets from networks and for this purpose, we will try to create a python script that can capture those Data Packets and also analyze and represent packets in easy to understandable form. Normally, This Types of programs used by pentesters and by network administrators. But For Understanding Networking Concept Clearly, You Can Also Create This Sniffer.

Now, Second Query which comes to our mind Is exactly
Q 2. How This Programs Going to Works?
Ans. Actually, This Programs works on a Very Clear Concept. As I already told you in previous lines, Every Client Interact With Server Through Sending and receiving various types of data Packets like TCP, UDP etc. so, our program is going to capture all those data packets from our local computer network and then analyze and represent those packets in easy to understandable ways.  In Simple Words, every networking service and networking program works on sending and receiving packet concept so what we need? is just to capture all traveling packets from our network.


Q 3. How To Capture Packets?

Ans.  Of course, for this job we are going to use socket module. basically, socket module is the main player in our games because in python programming language socket module provides us the facility to play with network concept. so here for capturing packets, we are going to use socket.socket module.

For sniffing with socket module in python we have to create a socket.socket class object with special configuration. In simple words, we have to configure socket.socket class object to capture low-level packets from the network so that it can capture packet from low-level networks and provides us output without doing any type of changes in capture packets.

Actually, Friends, there is a small difference in Python socket module codes based on operating systems. Because Windows kernel works in a different way compared to Linux kernel.


If You Are Using  Windows Then, Use This Codes,


s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_RAW,socket.IPPROTO_IP)
s.bind(("YOUR_INTERFACE_IP",0))
s.setsockopt(socket.IPPROTO_IP,socket.IP_HDRINCL,1)
s.ioctl(socket.SIO_RCVALL,socket.RCVALL_ON)


or if you are using *nix then, use this code.

s=socket.socket(socket.PF_PACKET, socket.SOCK_RAW, socket.ntohs(0x0800))


Now our socket object is ready to capture packets. friends, it's time to do dirty your hands with python programs. so, let's create a simplest packet sniffer script in python.


SimpleSniffer.py


#!/usr/bin/python
#
# Simplest Form Of Packet sniffer in python
# Works On Linux Platform 
 
#import module
import socket
 
#create an INET, raw socket
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_RAW, socket.IPPROTO_TCP)
 
# receive a packet
while True:

   # print output on terminal
   print s.recvfrom(65565)

Above Codes Explanation.

Line 7 is for importing modules
Line 10 for creating a socket.socket class object.
Line 13 for while loop
Line 16 for printing output on the terminal.



Done!

To Run This Program, Just Copy These Codes in Script and Run it With Sudo permission.

In Linux:

:~# sudo SimpleSniffer.py


Q 4. How To Parse/Extract Captured Packets?

Ans. Actually, There Are Various Types Of Data Formats Are Available In Networking. But For practice purpose Here, I Am only going to describe few Important And Most Usable Data Formats. In Order To Understand These Data formats, Let's Take A Look At Data Structure Diagrams.

So, Pay Attention To These Diagrams.
Ethernet Frame Format 

Friends, As you can see in Ethernet Frame Format Diagram There are more than 3 fields to extract but here, for this project we are only going to extract only 3 fields, Source Mac Address, Destination Mac Address and Ethernal Protocol Type.

Well, I am assuming that you already aware of the struct and binascii python module.

To Extract Source Address, Destination Address, and Ethernet Type Address, We have to use struct module which can unpack network packets for us.

Basically, To Extract Data From Network Packets we have to pass an argument that going to represent field types, we want to extract in struct.unpack function.


For Example:


pattern = <SourceMac> + <DestinationMac> + <EthernetType>
pattern = <"6s"> + <"6s"> + <"H">
pattern = "!6s6sH"

In this example, s represent string data type, H represent Unsigned Short data types and numbers means times to use. like "6s" = "ssssss"
And at the starting ! means, extract data in reverse order. I hope you already know that receiver always receive data in reverse order because of various networking reasons.
Let's create a dummy function to extract data from Ethernet frame and represent it in simplest form.



# Ethernet Header
def eth_header(data):
  storeobj=data
  storeobj=struct.unpack("!6s6sH",storeobj)
  destination_mac=binascii.hexlify(storeobj[0])
  source_mac=binascii.hexlify(storeobj[1])
  eth_protocol=storeobj[2]
  data={"Destination Mac":destination_mac,
  "Source Mac":source_mac,
  "Protocol":eth_protocol}
  return data

I hope now you got the idea exactly how our program is going to work.

Now, from here I am going to left other packet extracting function on user to understand it yourself.


ICMP Header Format




# ICMP HEADER Extraction


def icmp_header(data):


  icmph=struct.unpack('!BBH', data)


  icmp_type = icmph[0]


  code = icmph[1]


  checksum = icmph[2]


  data={'ICMP Type':icmp_type,


"Code":code,


"CheckSum":checksum}


return data 

IP Header Format





# IP Header Extraction


def ip_header(data):


  storeobj=struct.unpack("!BBHHHBBH4s4s", data)


  _version=storeobj[0] 


  _tos=storeobj[1]


  _total_length =storeobj[2]


  _identification =storeobj[3]


  _fragment_Offset =storeobj[4]


  _ttl =storeobj[5]


  _protocol =storeobj[6]


  _header_checksum =storeobj[7]


  _source_address =socket.inet_ntoa(storeobj[8])


  _destination_address =socket.inet_ntoa(storeobj[9])


  data={'Version':_version,


"Tos":_tos,


"Total Length":_total_length,


"Identification":_identification,


"Fragment":_fragment_Offset,


"TTL":_ttl,


"Protocol":_protocol,


"Header CheckSum":_header_checksum,


"Source Address":_source_address,


"Destination Address":_destination_address}


return data



TCP Header Format




















# Tcp Header Extraction


def tcp_header(data):


  storeobj=struct.unpack('!HHLLBBHHH',data)


  _source_port =storeobj[0] 


  _destination_port =storeobj[1]


  _sequence_number =storeobj[2]


  _acknowledge_number =storeobj[3]


  _offset_reserved =storeobj[4]


  _tcp_flag =storeobj[5]


  _window =storeobj[6]


  _checksum =storeobj[7]


  _urgent_pointer =storeobj[8]


  data={"Source Port":_source_port,


"Destination Port":_destination_port,


"Sequence Number":_sequence_number,


"Acknowledge Number":_acknowledge_number,


"Offset &amp; Reserved":_offset_reserved,


"Tcp Flag":_tcp_flag,


"Window":_window,


"CheckSum":_checksum,


"Urgent Pointer":_urgent_pointer

}

return data 

UDP Header Format


 # ICMP HEADER Extraction
 def icmp_header(data):
  icmph=struct.unpack('!BBH', data)
  icmp_type = icmph[0]
  code = icmph[1]
  checksum = icmph[2]
  data={'ICMP Type':icmp_type,
  "Code":code,
  "CheckSum":checksum}
  return data

PyPacket Project
i hope friends, from above examples you got the basic idea how our program is exactly going to work. Actually, Now we are going to assemble all above previewed functions in one program so that our program can extract various types of informations during sniffing. well here to make this project easy to understand i am going to divide our project in two script. 
First script is for sniffing packets and
another script for extracting data from captured packets.

So, let's Start our Python Packet Sniffer Coding.

For This Purpose, We will Create 2 Script.

1. For Capturing Packets (pypackets.py)

2. For Extracting Captured Data (pye.py)

So Here it's Our Demo Codes

1. For Capturing Packets
