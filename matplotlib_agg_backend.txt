userwaring: matplotlib is currently using agg, which is a non-GUI backend, so cannot show the figure



On my Ubuntu machine this gives me a value of agg ; however, through my testing and debugging, this value needs to be TkAgg  for the TkInter windowing system (at least when using Ubuntu and Raspbian).

Luckily, we can resolve this issue by using apt-get  to install a few libraries:

Resolved: Matplotlib figures not showing up or displayingShell

$ sudo apt-get install tcl-dev tk-dev python-tk python3-tk


But we’re not quite done yet. In order to get matplotlib to recognize the TkInter GUI library, we need to:

Step 1: Use pip to uninstall matplotlib (since we installed it via pip earlier in this article).
Step 2: Pull down matplotlib from the GitHub repo.
Step 3: Install matplotlib  from source using setup.py .

使用源码安装的情况下，可以再执行一次安装程序：
../matplotlib-3.0.2# python3 setup.py install
