Autostarting services

The easiest way is to just use the systemd service framework, like is already in use by the demo image.
 
To add a new service, just create a file in /lib/systemd/system/myservice.service with content like:
    [Unit]
    Description=Reverse SSH Service
    ConditionPathExists=|/usr/bin
    After=network.target
     
    [Service]
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/wall "Hello world!"
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=10
    StartLimitInterval=0
     
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

And then make a symlink to this file in /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/.
root@beaglebone:/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants# ln /lib/systemd/system/roller_coaster.service roller_coaster.service 
The service will start automatically on startup. You can also start and stop it manually, and query the status:
 
    systemctl status myservice.service
    systemctl start myservice.service
    systemctl stop myservice.service
