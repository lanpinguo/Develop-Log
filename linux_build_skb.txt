So the deal would be to allocate only the data buffer for the NIC to
populate its RX ring buffer. And use build_skb() at RX completion to
attach a data buffer (now filled with an ethernet frame) to a new skb,
initialize the skb_shared_info portion, and give the hot skb to network
stack.

build_skb() is the function to allocate an skb, caller providing the
data buffer that should be attached to it. Drivers are expected to call 
skb_reserve() right after build_skb() to let skb->data points to the
Ethernet frame (usually skipping NET_SKB_PAD and NET_IP_ALIGN)
