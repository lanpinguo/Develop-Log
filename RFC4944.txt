   packets MUST be carried on data frames.

 Starting from a maximum
   physical layer packet size of 127 octets (aMaxPHYPacketSize) and a
   maximum frame overhead of 25 (aMaxFrameOverhead), the resultant
   maximum frame size at the media access control layer is 102 octets.
   Link-layer security imposes further overhead, which in the maximum
   case (21 octets of overhead in the AES-CCM-128 case, versus 9 and 13
   for AES-CCM-32 and AES-CCM-64, respectively) leaves only 81 octets
   available.
