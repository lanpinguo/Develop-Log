LLVM libc++ for NuttX
I was looking for a C++11 lib to integrated on NuttX for a customer's project because uClibc++ doesn't have the C++11 features they need. Then David suggested me to take a look on LLVM's libcxx.

Finally I integrated libcxx on NuttX in the same way uClibc++ was integrated.

Case you have a STM32F4Discovery board and want to test, just follow these steps:

$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/acassis/libcxx
Cloning into 'libcxx'...


$ cd libcxx/
libcxx$ ./install.sh ../nuttx
Installing LLVM/libcxx in the NuttX source tree
Installation suceeded

libcxx$ cd ../nuttx/
nuttx$ tools/configure.sh stm32f4discovery/testlibcxx
nuttx$ make
