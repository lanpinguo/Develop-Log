I've just figured it out. I solve it out by uninstalling the cython module and then reinstalling a different version of it. As the official documentation says, there is not any kind of guarantee if the newer versions work fine while compilation. So, first uninstall cython:

pip uninstall cython
Install the version 0.23:

pip install cython==0.23
And then again install Kivy, and make sure there's no error while compilation:

pip install kivy
Hope, this will work fine.
