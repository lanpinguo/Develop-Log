SecureCRT Configuration for AWS with PEM

To use an Amazon EC2 "key pair" with SecureCRT, specify the private key file of the key pair generated by Amazon as the identity or certificate file. This file typically has a .pem extension.
If you want this to be a global configuration, you would configure it in the SSH2 category of Global Options.

If you want it to be session-specific, go to the Connection / SSH2 category of Session Options, choose the PublicKey authentication type, then press the Properties... button. You probably want the PublicKey auth method at the top of the list as well.
